# Douban_Flask

## Introduction

A simple web-based data visualization of the dataset obtained in the repositary: https://github.com/luckyberen/Douban_Top250_Movies_Crawler. There are both English and Chinese versions of visualization. The Top 250 movie list, distribution of ratings, and word cloud are included in the pages. I did not use github pages because the dataset is a SQLite database file, which is not convenient to be shown in this format.

## Reference
The project is based on the online course: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12E411A7ZQ.
